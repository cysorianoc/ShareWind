Meeting agenda

1. General Activities: The meeting commenced with updates on upcoming projects, notably one with Technip focusing on suction caissons in clay under sustained load for Tension Leg Platforms applied to floating wind turbines. A PhD thesis is set to begin in October 2024, preceded by a master’s internship to train a graduate student (collaboration with Christelle). Challenges with the loading system of actuators were discussed, and efforts to address these issues, such as implementing a new loading control system, were outlined. Test SW02 scheduling, set for late February, was proposed, with a laboratory general meeting planned for January 8th. Cristian is currently working on submitting two project deliverables in December: the Data Management Plan and Career Development Plan.
1. NGI Secondment (Ending on December 15th): Cristian presented some of the activities conducted at the NGI, primarily focusing on self-training in Plaxis

   to model suction caissons in clay. NGI’s specialist, Hans Peter JOSTAD, provided advice on numerical models. Additionally, there was a suggestion to explore the cyclic modeling framework employed at the NGI, encompassing concepts such as the transformation of complex load histories into equivalent cyclic loads, using the rainflow count method. Furthermore, a literature review will be conducted on the UDCAM model, which could serve as an alternative for simulating the soil/structure response of suction caissons subjected to cyclic loading.

In the last week at the NGI, Cristian will present the advancements in ShareWind’s research proposal, exploring potential future collaborations with an ongoing NGI project related to shared anchors.

3. New Centrifuge Test Considerations: We discussed several alternatives for tests related to SW02 and the type of load to be applied. One possibility is to conduct three load tests as follows: anchor 1 subjected to a monotonic load and applied at the ”optimal” location, aimed at minimizing rotations, roughly at 2/3 depth measured from the ground level; anchor 2 subjected to cyclic load in one direction; anchor 3 subjected to multidirectional load, in which the resultant force will vary in a predominant direction (+- 30 degrees).

   There are several aspects to consider regarding cyclic load, such as the frequency, number of cycles, amplitude, and average load (possibly as a percentage of mono- tonic load resistance?). The installation of the caissons for test SW02 will be at 1g; however, there is the possibility for future tests to conduct the installation in flight.

Several tasks are still pending from Cristian’s side, including the proposal of the setup to measure the displacements of the anchors when loaded. This involves primarily using potentiometers instead of lasers and installing a camera to follow a marker or markers to perform Digital Image Correlation analysis, serving as an additional source of data on anchor displacements.

For the comparison of the three types of tests, we could discuss a predominant load direction to observe the monotonic versus single cyclic and multidirectional cyclic load capacity, as well as the accumulation of displacements.
