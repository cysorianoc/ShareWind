# Multidirectional load multipliers

The load multipliers presented in this dataset are based on the multiline anchor loads calculated for a spar floating wind turbine presented by:

Balakrishnan, K., Arwade, S.R., DeGroot, D.J., Fontana, C., Landon, M., Aubeny, C.P., 2020. *Comparison of multiline anchors for offshore wind turbines with spar and with semisubmersible*. Journal of Physics: Conference Series, **1452**, 012032. [doi:10.1088/1742-6596/1452/1/012032](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1452/1/012032).

## Files

Load multipliers for three load cases grouped in Wind Wave and Current directions. Those are the loads arriving at a multiline anchor.
